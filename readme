This is a simple tool for recovering deleted bson document from mongodb's db file

if you execute db.collection.remove() mistakenly, you can try this tool to recover the deleted records.

the following is the recommended steps:
    1. shutdown mongodb quickly
    2. copy the db files(e.g /data/db/xxx.3) to a safe directory
    3. execute mongorecover
        python ./mongorecover.py {safe-directory}/xxx.3

this program has saved me, hope it works for you
